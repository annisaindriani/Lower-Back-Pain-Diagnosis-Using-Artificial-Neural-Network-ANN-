# Lower Back Pain Diagnosis Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
## Description
This project aims to assist in diagnosing Lower Back Pain using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 310 rows and 14 columns. It required thorough preprocessing to address issues such as missing values and inconsistencies. To tackle the class imbalance present in the data, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed, ensuring a more balanced distribution of classes. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, providing a solid foundation for model training.

The ANN architecture was designed with three hidden layers, where the first layer consists of 512 neurons, and subsequent layers are reduced by half, utilizing the sigmoid activation function. The output layer employs the softmax activation function to categorize the results. After evaluating the initial architecture, adjustments were made to optimize accuracy, including modifications to hyperparameters and layer configurations. The performance of the model was assessed on a test set, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, which highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in addressing Lower Back Pain diagnosis.
